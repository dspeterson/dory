   Provides scatter-reads and gather-writes over a socket.

   The transceiver object manages the vector array used in scatter/gather I/O.
   Call GetIoVecs() to get an array of sufficient size, then fill in the
   elements of the array to point to your data.  Then call Send() or Recv()
   repeatedly until the transfer is complete.

   Here's an example:

      TTranceiver xver;
      auto *vecs = xver.GetIoVecs(2);
      vecs[0].iov_base = "Hello, ";
      vecs[0].iov_len  = 7;
      vecs[1].iov_base = "world!";
      vecs[1].iov_len  = 6;

      for (size_t part = 0; xver; xver += part) {
        part = xver.Send(sock_fd);
      }
