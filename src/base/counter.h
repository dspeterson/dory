  /* A counter useful for providing health reports.

     Declare counters in your static data segment, then increment them during
     server operations.  You can later query the counters to discover how many
     times particular operations have been done.

     For example, this counter will keep track of the number of connections a
     listening socket accepts:

        static TCounter Connections(HERE, "Connections");

        void MainLoop(int sock) {
          for (;;) {
            int new_sock = accept(sock, 0, 0);
            Connections.Increment();
            ... handle the connection...
            close(new_sock);
          }
        }

     You may also use the COUNTER() macro to simplify the above declaration:

        DEFINE_COUNTER(Connections);

     When you want to query your counters, you must first call Sample().  This
     will copy all of the counters' values, adding them to the sampled values.
     You may then query these sampled values while the counters continue to
     count.

     For example:

        void DumpCounters(ostream &strm) {
          TCounter::Sample();
          for (const TCounter *counter = TCounter::GetFirstCounter(); counter;
               counter = counter->GetNextCounter()) {
            strm << counter->GetCodeLocation()
                 << " '" << counter->GetName() << "' "
                 << counter->GetCount()
                 << endl;
          }
        }

     You may also call Reset(), which resets all the sampled values to zero.
     Doing this periodically helps to avoid overflows; however, the counters
     are unsigned 32-bit numbers, so don't sweat it.

     You may also call GetSampleTime() to get the time at which the counters
     were last sampled, and GetResetTime() to get the time at which the
     counters were last reset.  These times are drawn from the system clock.

     The counters in the program are kept in a singly-linked list formed during
     pre-main initialization.  The GetFirstCounter() and GetNextCounter()
     functions allow you to access this list.  The counters appear in no
     particular order. */
