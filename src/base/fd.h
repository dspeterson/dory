  /* An RAII container for an OS file descriptor.

     This is a value type.  If you copy an instance of this class, it will use
     dup() to copy the file descriptor it contains (if any).

     This class implicitly casts to int, so you can use an instance of it in
     any call where you would normally pass a naked file descriptor.

     You can construct an instance of this class to capture the result of a
     function, such as the OS function socket(), which returns a newly created
     file descriptor.

     For example:

        TFd sock(HERE, socket(IF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP));

     If socket() fails (and so returns a negative value), the TFd constructor
     will throw an instance of std::system_error.

     You may also pass a naked file descriptor in the stdio range (0-2) to this
     constructor.  In this case, the newly constructed object will hold the
     file desciptor, but it will not attempt to close it. */
