  /* Class for limiting the rate of occurrence of an event.
     Template parameters:

         TTimePoint: a data type representing a point in time
         TDuration: a data type representing a length of time

     For instance, to limit the output rate of a log message to a maximum of
     once every 30 seconds, you might write code like this:

         using TClock = std::chrono::steady_clock;
         using TTimePoint = TClock::time_point;
         using TDuration = TTimePoint::duration;

         static TRateLimiter<TTimePoint, TDuration>
         rate_limiter(&TClock::now, std::chrono::seconds(30));

         if (rate_limiter.Test()) {
           syslog(LOG_INFO, "Blah blah");
         }

     Note that this class is not thread safe.  If you want a thread safe
     version, see TThreadSafeRateLimiter.
