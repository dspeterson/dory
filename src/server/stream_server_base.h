     types such as TCP/IPv4, TCP/IPv6, and UNIX domain stream sockets.  Each

         Parameters:

             sock: The socket file descriptor for the new connection.  On
                 return, this must be empty.  Typically, the implementation
                 will transfer the socket to a worker thread.
             addr: A pointer to the sockaddr structure containing info about
                 the connected client.  This is the same pointer passed to the
                 TStreamServerBase constructor, and is passed to accept().  If
                 the implementation code for this method wants to preserve this
                 information, it must make its own copy since the memory will
                 be reused for the next client connection.
             addr_len: The size in bytes of the data pointed to by 'addr'.
                 This value is obtained from the call to accept().  If 'addr'
                 is null, this will be 0.

       return until the acceptor thread has either successfully called listen()
       or encountered a failure preventing a successful call to listen().
       Therefore, on return it is guaranteed that you can connect to the server

               info.
           addr_space: Size in bytes of space pointed to by 'addr', or 0 if
               'addr' is null.
           connection_handler: Pointer to an object whose purpose is to handle
               new client connections.  The TStreamServerBase takes ownership
               of 'connection_handler', and is responsible for its destruction.
