         shutdown wait FD readable, and then the router thread calls JoinAll().

         Shutdown mechanism for metadata refresh is similar to shutdown on
         pause, except that it is initiated by router thread rather than a
         connector thread.

         Slow shutdown mechanism is also similar to shutdown on pause, except
         connector thread continues sending until it empties its queue or the
         time limit runs out.

         Emergency stop should never happen in practice.  In this case, the
