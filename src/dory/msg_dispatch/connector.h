         outdated, or encounters a serious error such as a socket error that
         prevents further communication with the broker.  Whe one connector
         triggers a pause, all other connectors react by entering the fast
         shutdown state.  Once all connector threads have terminated, the
         router thread updates the metadata and restarts the dispatcher.  This

             - The connector detects a pause initiated by another connector,
               and reacts by entering fast shutdown.

             - The connector receives an error ACK in a produce response,
               indicating that metadata needs updating, and reacts by entering
               fast shutdown.

         want to continue processing produce responses until there are no more
         to process, or the fast shutdown time limit expires.  In the case of a
         socket error or receipt of unexpected response data from Kafka
