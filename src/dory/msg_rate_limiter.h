  /* This class is used for rate limiting of messages on a per-topic basis.
     The motivation is to deal with situations in which buggy client code sends
     an unreasonably large volume of messages to some topic T.  Without rate
     limiting, this might stress the Kafka cluster to the point where it can no
     longer keep up with the message volume.  The result is likely to be
     slowness in message processing that affects many topics, causing Dory to
     discard messages across many topics.  The goal of rate limiting is to
     contain the damage by discarding excess messages for topic T, preventing
     the Kafka cluster from becoming overwhelmed and forcing Dory to discard
     messages for other topics. */
