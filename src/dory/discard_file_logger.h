    /* Must be called only during server startup _before_ any log entries can
       be written, since this initializes the internal state of the singleton
       without any thread synchronization.  If this method is never called, the
       singleton will still be in a sane state, but logging will be disabled.

       'log_path' specifies the absolute pathname of the logfile.
       'max_file_size' specifies the maximum logfile size in bytes.  When the
       logfile size reaches a point where the next log entry would cause it to
       exceed 'max_file_size', a new logfile is started as follows, assuming
       that the logfile name is '/var/log/dory/discard.log':

           1.  The current logfile is renamed.  Suppose the current time in
               milliseconds since the epoch is 1393271771000.  Then the logfile
               will be renamed to '/var/log/dory/discard.log.1393271771000'.

           2.  A new file '/var/log/dory/discard.log' is created.  The next
               log entry goes to this file.

       'max_archive_size' specifies a limit on the combined size of old
       logfiles, which are created as described above.  Each time a new logfile
       is started, a thread is awakened which scans the logfile directory
       ('/var/log/dory' in the above example) for old logfiles.  In the above
       example, old logfiles are recognized as files whose names match the
       pattern 'discard.log.N' where 'N' is a string of digits interpreted as
       an integer number of milliseconds since the epoch.  If the combined size
       of all old logfiles exceeds 'max_archive_size', then old logfiles are
       deleted in order from oldest to newest until 'max_archive_size' is no
       longer exceeded. */
